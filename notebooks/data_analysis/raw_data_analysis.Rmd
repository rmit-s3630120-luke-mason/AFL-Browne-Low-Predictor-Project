title: "Raw Exploratory Data Analysis"
output: html_notebook
---
This project was conducted by Thomas Johnstone, Richard, and Luke Mason, with supervision from RMIT Lecturer Dr Haydar Demirhan Bayesian Statistics 2022.

This notebooks purpose is to explore the raw data before it has been pre-processed to give any insights on it before decisions are made to either preprocess it and what needs can or can't be met with the current data.

##### Import Packages and source code
These are the necessary packages and code needed to run the following code samples.
```{r}
source("../../utilities/DBDA2E-utilities.R") 
source("../../utilities/MoreUtilities.R")
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(ks)
library(rjags)
library(runjags)
library(benchmarkme)
```


## Load in the Raw Stats
```{r}
raw_stats = read.csv("../../data/raw_stats.csv")
column(raw_stats)
```


## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Attach the data to memory
Attaching the data to memory allows us to access the keys of the columns without mentioning the dataset, gives us short hand access to the fields.
```{r}
attach(raw_stats)
```

### Peek at the stats
```{r}
head(raw_stats)
```

### A Summary of the stats
```{r}
summary(raw_stats)
```

### Histograms of frequencies
These are the histograms of each stat field for all games over 10 years.

```{r}
print(names(raw_stats))
```
### Analysis of the raw data
```{r}
for (val in 1:ncol(raw_stats)) {
  colName <- names(raw_stats)[val]
  
  
  if (purrr::has_element(c("displayName", "gameId", "playerId", "team", "year", "round", "gameNumber", "Subs"), colName)) {
    # Skip these fields
    next
  }
  
  title <- paste("Count of ", colName)
  hist(as.matrix(raw_stats[val]), xlab=colName, main=title)
}
```

```{r}
table(raw_stats$round)
```

# Density function.
```{r}
for (val in 1:ncol(raw_stats)) {
  colName <- names(raw_stats)[val]
  
  
  if (purrr::has_element(c("displayName", "gameId", "playerId", "team", "year", "round", "gameNumber", "Subs", "Hit.Outs", "Brownlow.Votes", "Bounces"), colName)) {
    # Skip these fields
    next
  }
  print(colName)
  title <- paste("Density of ", colName)
  plot(kde(unlist(raw_stats[val])), xlab=colName, main=title)
}
```


# Scatterplot of brownlow votes vs each stat type
```{r}
for (val in 1:ncol(raw_stats)) {
  colName <- names(raw_stats)[val]
  
  
  if (purrr::has_element(c("displayName", "gameId", "playerId", "team", "year", "round", "gameNumber", "Subs", "Brownlow.Votes"), colName)) {
    # Skip these fields
    next
  }
  title <- paste("Brownlow Votes vs ", colName)
  plot(unlist(raw_stats["Brownlow.Votes"]) ~ unlist(raw_stats[val]), data=raw_stats, xlab=colName, ylab="Brownlow Votes", main=title)
}

```
